Abstract:

In this research, the trapping of dielectric silica nanospheres in a modulated potential is explored in the underdamped regime. The particle is trapped via the method of optical tweezers in which a focused gaussian laser beam of wavelength much higher than the nanosphere’s diameter is used. The f ield of the beam induces a dipole moment in the particle thus attratcing it to its gradient thereby trapping it. In order to study the particle’s dynamics in the underdamped regime, the optical trap in the setup operates in a vacuum chamber, such that the pressure is decreased, decreasing the damping rate to be much lower than the oscillation frequency of the particle. The trapping potential is modulated through modulating the beam intensities by utilizing an electro-optic modulator (EOM), which is coupled to a function generator, such that a square wave function is generated, allowing us to observe the particle’s reactions to sudden changes in the potential. The results of the study focus on analysing the power spectral density of the oscillations, the position distribution of the particle and its evolution with time upon modulating the trap’s intensity. Studies focused on optical trapping of nanoparticles, in the underdamped regimes allow for the development of the fields of quantum optics and the mechanics of mesoscopic objects
